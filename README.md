> This is our home page! It was first created in GIMP and then translated into HTML and CSS to reflect the design
> initially created, which can be seen in /design-ideas.

![About Me Page](assets/Screenshot%202.png)

> A simple about me page

![Adoptions Page](assets/Screenshot%203.png)

> This is where the magic happens, you can see here two buttons. The meet me, and adopt me button. 
> The meet me button generates a small, simple page showing your new, furry friend!
> The adopt me button takes you to an adoption request form.

> Here you can see it in action! Once meet me is pressed, a dog is fetched (pardon the pun) for you to meet!
> You can then move onto the adopt me page, which is a fillable form for adoption inquiries.

> A simple contact us form for any questions, comments or concerns.

This project is a dog adoption website that generates details of a random dog that's available for adoption. Once the user likes the dog they want to adopt, they will be directed to the adoption form page where they have to fill out their personal details. The goal for this website was to make it an easy process for families to find a dog they are looking to adopt.
